A man walks into a bar. He orders a beer. The bartender asks him what he wants.

Man: I want to see the moon.

Bartender: You see, I have a wife and two kids, all of whom are avid hikers. I would be honored to help them.

Man: I know. I've seen everything they do in here. They make beer, they sell beer, they read the newspaper, they drive around in tanks of beer, they play poker, they get into arguments with each other, they spend a lot of time in front of their tanks of beer, and I'm counting on my wife to provide me with a good beer when I need it.

Bartender: That's right. I'm counting on you.

Man: I'm really not much for drinking, so I'm not going to waste beer on women.

Bartender: I'm not counting on you either.

With the weather in the forecast for the upcoming snow season, Forecast.com has put together a handy guide to snow-related activity in your area.

The following are some of the activities that might be a good idea to plan ahead for during the winter months.

Snowmobiling
Snowmobiling is something you do in front of a computer screen, using a mouse and a keyboard. It's important to you, as it keeps your computer from scrolling, slowing down the computer, and making your PC unable to read your files.

You can watch videos on your TV, using a two-way mirror, or use a pair of binoculars.

Staring at a computer monitor during a snow emergency is a good idea, as it lets your eyes see over the snow, and out of sight.

Golf
Parking is free at most of the US National Forests, and there is an entire section of the country park that is closed

At 7 a.m., we stopped at the parking lot to park. We took the right into the parking lot, and parked there, as usual, so we could get back on the road. Unfortunately, there were only a few cars left of the lot, so we went right into the parking lot and got out as we normally would, and we were not allowed to get into the parking lot again until about 2 a.m. It was nearly 2 a.m. and we decided to get out of the car. We 
got out, walked around the lot, and went into the parking lot. When we got back into the car, the parking lot attendant told us to get off of the lot just like we normally would. After we got off we realized that we were in a parking lot with a parking ticket. So we just sat there and waited for the attendant. He then told us that there was a $100 fine for exceeding the speed limit. So we sat there
